# FocusFlow

## Project overview

   In today's digital age, maintaining focus and productivity has become increasingly challenging.
   
  Studies show that the average person is distracted every 40 seconds when working at their
computer, leading to decreased productivity and increased stress, particularly among students
and professionals. 

  FocusFlow addresses this challenge by creating an integrated productivity
ecosystem that combines proven focus-enhancement techniques with engaging features.

## User Story
  
  As a busy college student, it's imperative to find a productivity
tool that helps you manage your time efficiently. When you open
FocusFlow, you're immediately presented with your task list, and
you can start a Pomodoro session with a single click.

  During study sessions, the timer keeps you focused, and gentle
notifications let you know when it’s time for a break. You can
easily add new tasks as they come and check them off once
completed.
   
   The basic analytics show how many tasks you’ve completed and
how much focused time you’ve accumulated, helping you
understand your productivity patterns. Theme customization
allows you to work comfortably, even at the end of a long day.
  
  The more you use the app, the more you can organize your tasks
into categories and break them down into manageable subtasks.
  
  FocusFlow helps you stay on track without overwhelming you
with complex features. It's straightforward: add a task, do the
task, complete the task. Nice and easy

## Technical approach

  The main technical approach for FocusFlow is to create a
comprehensive productivity application built on solid
object-oriented programming principles. 

FocusFlow integrates several key components:

1.) A task management system built on dynamic data
structures for efficient task organization and tracking.

2.) A pomodoro timer system that helps users maintain
focus.

3.) An analytics engine that leverages Maps and Lists to
track and analyze user productivity measures.

4.) A reward system implementing interface-based design
for extensible gamification.

 5.) A flexible notification system using Queue-based
architecture for managing user alerts.

6.) A theme management system allowing for deep
customization of the user experience.
