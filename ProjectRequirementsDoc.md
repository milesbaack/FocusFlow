# FocusFlow Project Requirements Document

## Project Overview

FocusFlow is a comprehensive productivity application designed to address the growing challenge of maintaining focus in today's digital environment. Built using Java and leveraging robust data structures, FocusFlow combines the proven Pomodoro technique with engaging gamification elements to help users enhance their productivity. The application integrates task management, focus timers, analytics, customization, and achievement systems in a cohesive ecosystem. Studies show that the average person is distracted every 40 seconds when working at their computer, leading to decreased productivity and increased stress, particularly among students and professionals. FocusFlow aims to break this cycle by creating an integrated productivity environment that makes focus sessions rewarding and manageable while providing users with insights into their productivity patterns.

| FR-017 | Binaural Beats | Focus Tools | The application shall provide customizable binaural beat audio designed to enhance different mental states (focus, creativity, relaxation) during work sessions. |
| FR-018 | Theme Customization | Personalization | Users shall be able to switch between light and dark themes and customize color schemes to reduce eye strain and match personal preferences. |
| FR-019 | Subtasks | Task Management | Tasks shall support hierarchical subtasks with independent completion tracking and aggregated progress display. |
| FR-020 | Task Categories | Task Management | Users shall be able to create and assign custom categories to tasks with color coding and filtering capabilities. |
